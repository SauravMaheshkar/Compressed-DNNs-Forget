# What Do Compressed Deep Neural Networks Forget?

This Project aims to reproduce the claims of the paper titled "What Do Compressed Deep Neural Networks Forget?" by Sara Hooker, Aaron Courville, Gregory Clark, Yann Dauphin and Andrea Frome. 

# Weights and Biases Project Page

Weights and Biases Client were used to conduct all the experiments. You can explore the Project [here](https://wandb.ai/sauravmaheshkar/exploring-bias-and-compression).


# Web Application

You can interact with the web app at this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/sauravmaheshkar/compressed-dnns-forget/web-app/app.py). Some identified PIE's are also available on the website.
